## Why Press Flowers?

--

### Scientific Herbaria

Document plant species, preserve traditional botanical knowledge, support research

--

### Arts & Crafts

Cards, bookmarks, framed art, jewelry, candles, home decor

--

### Culinary Uses

Decorate cakes, cookies, ice cubes, garnishes for elegant presentation

--

### Memory Preservation

Wedding bouquets, garden favorites, gifts from loved ones, travel mementos

--

### Education

Teach botany, connect with nature, mindful observation, journaling

--

### Local Flora Documentation

Record Arizona's unique desert wildflowers and native plants

*Herbarium specimens collected 200+ years ago are still used for research today*

---

## Flower Anatomy: Know Your Parts

--

### Petals (Corolla)
Colorful structures that attract pollinators – Press best when thin

--

### Sepals (Calyx)
Green, leaf-like structures protecting the bud – Usually press well

--

### Stamens (Male Parts)
Filament + anther with pollen – Remove if too bulky

--

### Pistil (Female Parts)
Stigma, style, ovary – Central structure, may need to be thinned

--

### Stem & Leaves
Vascular tissue, support – Thick stems may need to be sliced

--

### Why this matters for pressing:

Understanding structure helps you know what to remove, flatten, or slice for best results

*Thick, fleshy parts hold more moisture and take longer to dry—plan accordingly*

---

## The Science of Color: Why Flowers Fade

--

### Plant Pigments

| Pigment | Colors | Stability |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Chlorophyll | Green | Breaks down quickly |
| Carotenoids | Yellow, orange, red | Relatively stable |
| Anthocyanins | Red, purple, blue | pH-sensitive, may shift |

--

### What Causes Color Loss?

- **Light Exposure** – UV rays break down pigment molecules
- **Oxidation** – Air exposure causes chemical reactions
- **Moisture** – Incomplete drying causes browning and mold

--

### Color Retention Guide

**Colors That Hold Well:**
Blue, purple, deep reds, yellows, oranges – Flowers with low moisture content

**Colors That Fade Quickly:**
White (turns ivory/brown), light pink, pale pastels – High-moisture flowers

*Different craft applications (resin vs. framed vs. laminated) affect long-term color retention*

---

## Best Flowers for Pressing

--

### Excellent (Flat, thin petals)

- Pansies & violas
- Cosmos
- Daisies
- Buttercups
- Lavender
- Forget-me-nots
- Queen Anne's lace
- Ferns & leaves

*Low moisture, thin structure*

--

### Moderate (Need preparation)

- Roses (press petals separately)
- Zinnias (remove center)
- Sunflowers (petals only)
- Hydrangeas (individual florets)
- Carnations (separate layers)
- California poppies

*Disassemble bulky flowers first*

--

### Challenging (High failure rate)

- Orchids (fleshy, high moisture)
- Tulips (thick, watery petals)
- Lilies (bulky, prone to browning)
- Peonies (many layers)
- Succulents (very fleshy)
- Most cacti flowers

*Too much moisture, thick tissue*

*Always pick flowers on a dry day, after morning dew has evaporated*

---

## Arizona & Desert Flowers to Press

*Many desert plants are surprisingly good for pressing—low moisture!*

--

### Native & Edible

- **Desert Chia** – Blue flowers, lovely pressed
- **Ocotillo** – Bright red flower spikes
- **Palo Verde** – Yellow flowers, edible!
- **Desert Ironwood** – Pink flowers
- **Wolfberry** – Small purple flowers
- **Desert Dandelion** – Yellow, flat
- **London Rocket** – Yellow mustard flowers

--

### Garden & Landscape

- **Lantana** – Colorful clusters
- **Bougainvillea** – Paper-thin bracts
- **Mexican Evening Primrose**
- **Globe Amaranth** – Holds color well
- **Nasturtiums** – Flat, edible!
- **Rosemary** – Tiny blue flowers
- **Lavender** – Fragrant, keeps scent

--

### Edible for Culinary

- **Borage** – Star-shaped, blue
- **Calendula** – Orange, healing
- **Pansies/Violas** – Classic choice
- **Herb flowers** – Basil, thyme, chives
- **Citrus blossoms** – Fragrant
- **Elderflower** – Delicate

**Only use pesticide-free flowers for food!**

*Never pick from protected lands – Avoid collecting endangered species*

---

## How to Press Flowers: Step by Step

--

### Step 1: Harvest at the Right Time

- Pick on a dry day, after dew evaporates
- Choose fresh, just-opened blooms
- Avoid damaged or wilted flowers

--

### Step 2: Prepare the Flowers

- Gently pat dry if needed
- Trim thick stems
- Disassemble bulky flowers
- Remove excess material

--

### Step 3: Arrange in Press

- Place between absorbent paper (blotting, newspaper, coffee filters)
- Face up for flat look
- Don't overlap flowers

--

### Step 4: Apply Pressure & Wait

- Tighten press or add heavy books
- Store in cool, dry, dark place
- Wait 2–4 weeks until fully dry

--

### Pro Tips

- Change paper every 2-3 days for faster drying
- Use cotton pads for chunky centers
- Slice thick stems in half lengthwise
- More pressure = faster drying

--

### Common Mistakes

- Pressing wet flowers (causes mold)
- Checking too often (disrupts process)
- Not enough pressure
- Removing before fully dry

*Properly pressed flowers can last decades when stored correctly*

---

## Creating a Scientific Herbarium

*Preserve knowledge – Document flora – Contribute to science*

--

### Essential Label Information

Every specimen needs:
- **Scientific name** (genus + species)
- **Common name(s)**
- **Collection date**
- **Location** (GPS if possible)
- **Habitat description**
- **Collector's name**
- **Notes** (flower color, scent, height)

*Document details BEFORE pressing—some won't be visible later!*

--

### Modern Storage Best Practices

**Archival Materials:**
- Acid-free mounting paper
- Archival glue (PVA, not regular glue)
- Linen tape or thread for heavy parts
- Fragment packets for loose pieces

**Storage Conditions:**
- Cool (50-65°F), low humidity
- Dark (light fades colors)
- Sealed cabinets or boxes
- Freeze new additions to kill pests

--

### Cultural Documentation

Consider recording:
- Traditional uses (medicinal, food, fiber)
- Indigenous names
- Folk knowledge about the plant
- Seasonal availability
- Associated species in habitat

*"Herbaria are libraries of nature—some specimens are 200+ years old and still used for research today."*
