## How It Works

- Slides are written in **Markdown**

### This is a vertical slide

Vertical slides are great for diving deeper into a topic.

---

## Features

- Clean, minimal design
- Code syntax highlighting
- Speaker notes (press `S`)
- Full-screen mode (press `F`)

## Code Example

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```
